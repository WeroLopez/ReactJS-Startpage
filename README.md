# ReactJS-Startpage

Startpage that I made for myself.

It have bookmarks, and search bars for google and youtube.
The background image is randomely selectd when the page loads, 
and the blend color change every second with the hour in hexadecimal.
You can add more background images, keeping the number names,
and changing the backgroundImagesCount var.
